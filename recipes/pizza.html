		<h2>Panarottis Special</h2>		

		<p>
			Above is my image of the pizza I will be discussing in my recipe. It originates from a local restaurant franchise here in South Africa
			called Panarottis and the name of the pizza itself is quite aptly named, the <em>"Pannarottis Special"</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pizza has been my favourite go to for a few years now since it's inception at the franchise, and although it breaks the societal rule
			of not accepting pineapple on pizza, I believe the strength of this recipe is more than made up for in it's use of calmatta olives and 
			salami.
