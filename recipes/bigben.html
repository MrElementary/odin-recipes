		<h2>Big Ben</h2>
		<p>
			As shown in the picture is my favourite version off the classic Eggs Benedict dish called the <em>Big Ben</em> by the local restaurant chain here in South Africa,
			<strong>Mugg & Bean</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			My go to for breakfast at any sit-down restaurant in our nearby area. This specific version of Eggs Benedict consists of the usual base ingredients of poached eggs,
			hollondaise sauce and toasted English muffin, as well as some additions in the form of baby spinach, hash browns and back bacon.

		<ol>
			<li>Gather all the ingredients you'll need: English muffin, Hollandaise sauce, poached egg, hickory ham, hash brown, cheddar cheese, baby spinach, back bacon, grilled tomato, and battered 				onion ring.</li>
			<li>Prepare the English muffin by slicing it in half horizontally. Toast the muffin halves until they are lightly browned.</li>
			<li>While the muffins are toasting, heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Cook the hickory ham slices until they are heated through and slightly browned. Set them aside.</li>
			<li>In the same skillet, cook the back bacon until it is crispy. Remove it from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
			<li>In a separate pan, prepare the hash brown according to the package instructions or your preferred method. Cook until they are golden brown and crispy. Set them aside.</li>
			<li>In the same skillet or a new one, lightly wilt the baby spinach over medium heat. This will only take a minute or two. Remove it from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
			<li>Slice the cheddar cheese into thin slices.</li>
			<li>To prepare the poached eggs, fill a large pot with water and bring it to a gentle simmer. Add a splash of vinegar to help the eggs hold their shape.
				Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin, then gently slide them into the simmering water.
				Cook the eggs for about 3-4 minutes until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
				Remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and set them on a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess water.</li>
			<li>While the eggs are poaching, heat a separate pan and grill the tomato slices until they are slightly softened and have grill marks. Remove them from the pan and set them aside.</li>
			<li>Prepare the battered onion ring according to the package instructions or your preferred method. Cook until they are crispy and golden brown. Set them aside.</li>
			<li>Assemble the Eggs Benedict: Place one toasted English muffin half on a plate. Top it with a handful of baby spinach leaves, a grilled tomato slice, a hash brown patty,
				a slice of cheddar cheese, a slice of back bacon, a battered onion ring, a poached egg, and finally,
				spoon a generous amount of Hollandaise sauce over the assembled stack of ingredients.</li>
			<li>Serve your homemade Eggs Benedict immediately and enjoy!</li>
